It's a light painter where each row of 8 is read in order with the hue of the pixel controlling the pitch. Eight sine waves are independently controlled by the 8 rows while the eight columns are the steps.</br>

This was a quick project to show what can be done with just a few components and some code.</br>

The "screen is made of two pieces of thick Baltic birch that were cut on the cnc the have holes for each APA102. The from is just a piece of delrin. A teensy using its audio.h library is doing all the work.</br>
